According to media reports, IiAS has raised concerns about the demerger's strategic and financial implications, urging shareholders to reconsider the proposed restructuring.The rationale behind the advisory firm's position is that ITC will retain a residual 40 percent stake in the demerged entity, effectively preventing shareholders from making a complete exit. The firm is not fundamentally opposed to the demerger itself but advocates a vertical split, ensuring the new business operates independently without financial support from the parent company.

During a session of the Asian Monetary Policy Forum on Friday, they were scolded for believing high inflation was consigned to the history books. They had too much faith in forward guidance and the implicit ability to accurately project the direction of economies, a former official told the conference in Singapore. Pledges that quantitative easing would be tapered before rates went up delayed a timely response. The consensus seemed to be that any scaling down this year will be minimal, almost tokenistic; conditions that would normally justify large cuts don’t exist.

(Source: Bloomberg/Getty images) Ten years ago, when Narendra Modi — then chief minister of business-friendly Gujarat state — rode an electoral wave to the prime ministership in New Delhi, many expected that he would be far more supportive of the private sector than previous Indian leaders. As a candidate, Modi wasquoted as saying: “I believe government has no business to do business,” and one of the many slogans of that 2014 campaign was “minimum government, maximum governance.” That seemed as close to laissez-faire Thatcherism as one could reasonably expect in India.Nobody who looked closely at Modi’s tenure in Gujarat, however, believed this easy narrative. His proudest achievement there was turning around the state government’s own public-sector companies, particularly in the energy sector. And that’s been his focus in national office as well. In one recent interview, when asked to cite an example of how the markets should react to his expected re-election, he pointed specifically and solely to how he had revived the stock prices of public-sector companies.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdModi wasn’t wrong.

 India's manufacturing firms can benefit as part of China Plus One strategy. The economic momentum in the April-June quarter of 2024-25 will continue with a likely boost in the merchandise exports as a result of supply chain resilience, while India’s macroeconomic buffers will help navigate through the risk of volatility in oil prices, the Finance Ministry said on May 24.“The Indian economy closed FY24 strongly with its growth surpassing market expectations, despite strong external headwinds. Early indications suggest a continuation of the economic momentum during the first quarter of FY25. The emerging robust trends in important high frequency indicators of growth like the GST collections, e-way bills, electronic toll collections, sale of vehicles, purchasing managers’ indices and the value and number of digital transactions attest to the growing strength of the economy,” the Finance Ministry said in its monthly economic review for April 2024.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThe industrial and service sectors of the Indian economy are performing well, backed by brisk domestic demand and partially by tentative external demand. This can benefit India's manufacturing firms as part of the China Plus One strategy. The EXIM Bank of India has forecasted that merchandise exports will post a double-digit growth in Q1 of FY25, it said.“Domestic manufacturing will likely receive stronger external support in the upcoming months. Modestly improved economic activity and consumer sentiment in Europe and a steady US economy have aided India’s exports in April. There are reports that show that the number of organisations in the US and Europe that are focusing on reindustrialisation has increased. The majority of these organisations are focussing on enhancing supply chain resilience,” the report stated.The unrelenting geopolitical tensions and volatility in global commodity prices, especially of petroleum products, present substantial multi-frontal challenges. Nonetheless, the expectation is that the macro-economic buffers nurtured and strengthened during the post-Covid management of the economy will help the Indian economy navigate these challenges reasonably smoothly, it added.

This study of networks has gained traction since the 2008 financial crisis and got another boost after supply chains got messed up during the pandemic across the globe. It has become imperative for policymakers to study networks, from supply chains to flow of finance in a departure from the staid macro and micro economics that have a top-down or bottom-up approach.Tett’s piece states, “To put it another way: while economists used to act like medieval doctors, making diagnoses by looking at body parts and deducing how these interact, they now aim to be more like physicians with microscopic cameras who watch how blood circulates in order to assess a patient’s health. Networks matter.”But what does this have to do with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)?

Anglo, built up through founder Ernest Oppenheimer’s control of the global diamond trade in the early 20th century, is a potluck of good and bad businesses these days that many bidders have shied away from. The prize for BHP is a rare opportunity to build its position in copper through shares in two world-beating Chilean copper mines: Collahuasi and Los Bronces.It’s the same story with Glencore Plc’s $27 billion plan last year to buy Teck Resources Ltd.

 As long as the dollar is full-fledged competition, stabilising the peso is not easy. The good news is that President Javier Milei seems to be backing away from plans to dollarise the Argentine economy. That is also the bad news.Don’t get me wrong: Dollarisation would be great — if the country had a spare $30 billion to back each peso with dollars. But Argentina doesn’t have that extra money ready at hand, and so the Milei regime is looking for some form of dollarisation that can both work and be worthy of the name.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdIn a recent speech, Milei seemed to suggest that formal dollarisation — as seen in El Salvador, Panama and Ecuador — isn’t going to happen. His remarks are somewhat confused, so it might be helpful to review different types of dollarisation and what they mean.First is what I call the Zimbabwe path to dollarisation: Just push the rate of inflation into the billions or trillions, and the native currency will be replaced by the US dollar. The mechanics are easy, but the process is tragic. It impoverishes the poor and members of the middle class who have been saving in the national currency, or who have written contracts or debts in it.A second method is to take the domestic currency and try to peg it to the dollar on a one-to-one basis. Argentina tried that in 1991. If Milei managed to establish a one-to-one peg of the Argentine peso against the dollar today, ask yourself: Which asset would you rather hold? The dollar of course, because of its greater security. Not surprisingly, the earlier Argentina dollar peg collapsed in 2002 once uncertainty about its credibility took hold, and high inflation followed once again.

The news published on the date May 23, 2024 12:02 PM IST with headline  Climate Finance: The pressing need for fair, inclusive, and equitable policies is: 
 green finance Climate finance today faces several challenges that need to be addressed speedily and decisively. First and foremost, it cannot be limited to renewable energy, but should encompass partnerships, programmes, and technologies that address long-standing challenges and advance Sustainability Development Goals.The existing climate finance mechanism, based on the “polluter pays” principle, says that developed countries should provide the larger share of climate finance. Rich countries that became ‘developed’ through decades-long industrialisation can afford to pay for the pollution they have caused. However, the poor and developing countries where climate finance is directed face the unenviable challenge of achieving socioeconomic development with limited resources and a wary eye on emissions. Some countries today impose a carbon tax or ‘ecotax’. However, instead of reducing fossil fuel consumption, it’s merely leading producers to pass the tax burden onto consumers.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdFurthermore, countries that can provide climate financing have apprehensions about how the money will be used. Accountability is essential for effective use of climate finance. The onus is on the lender to ensure that the project is economically viable, and the funds are used for the intended purpose. There have been instances of greenwashing in the past, and they underline the need for regulatory oversight.Climate financing today not only falls short of requirements but also puts developing countries at a disadvantage. Despite repeated requests for affordable, grant-based financing, climate finance continues to be largely in the form of loans. This is worrisome because most low-income countries are already facing debt distress and are only falling deeper into it. What we really need is viable, well-planned climate financing and a long-term multilateral debt workout process.Meanwhile, there continues to be gaps between commitments and disbursements of climate finance. The intended recipients are often unable to access or afford climate finance. Sometimes, financing comes at a different time than what was promised. Such issues erode trust in climate finance. Almost all disbursements are directed towards augmenting renewable energy resources, whereas there are many other sectors and SDGs that need climate finance. India, for instance, needs to invest in building robust healthcare infrastructure and in technologies that can re-power the solar and wind installations that are nearing the end of their life.

 Watching the data: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. (Source: Bloomberg/Getty Images North America) Whether traditionally thought of as “hawks” or “doves,” Federal Reserve officials have recently converged to notable uniformity in their policy signaling of high interest rates for longer. This has come at a time when more Wall Street analysts are embracing a wider band of uncertainty for their projections of economic growth and inflation. It is a situation that raises three risks to economic prosperity and financial stability.Shaken by a string of hotter-than-expected readings for all the major inflation measures in the first quarter, Fed officials have become more cautious about their previous expectations for continuously softening price pressures. Chair Jerome Powell summed up this shift last week when he said that his confidence in lower inflation is “not as high” as it was at the start of the year.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdWith a more chastened view on inflation — and against the backdrop of a damaging mischaracterization of inflation as “transitory” in 2021 — recent speeches by Fed officials have uniformly noted the importance of giving more time for restrictive monetary policy to work. The officials have pulled back on their expectations of rate cuts, saying that April’s less troubling inflation data was not enough of a confidence boost. Indeed, as Governor Christopher Waller re-iterated on Tuesday, Fed officials are looking for “several more” good inflation prints before reducing rates.Such uniformity doesn’t promise the economy and markets a free ride from here as it comes during a period when confidence in the Fed’s judgment and effectiveness has already been shaken. Indeed, three risks stand out.The first has to do with how highly and, I would argue, excessively reactive the Fed has become in its policy approach or, to use the most popular Fed phrase these days, its “data-dependent” approach. This led the central bank to pivot to more dovish signaling just last December, in turn giving markets the confidence to price in six or seven rate cuts for this year. The string of favorable inflation readings that prompted the pivot then gave way to less comforting data in the first quarter and, with that, the ongoing U-turn, with markets now expecting only one or two cuts.

 Noting the dependence on Chinese products, India is making special efforts to become self-reliant. It is no secret that India’s dependence on Chinese imports has been increasing and this has led to near deindustralisation of Indian economy. Our industries suffered major losses and many of them had to be closed down. It's significant that imports from China were hardly $4.05 billion in 2003-04; which increased to $51.1 billion by 2013-14, showing a growth of nearly 29 percent annually. With realization of this problem, the new government under Narendra Modi came up with an idea of ‘Make in India’ first and then a full-fledged ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ since May 2020, during COVID-19 pandemic.It is notable that the import of Chinese merchandise, which was doubling every two-and-a-half years, during UPA’s decade, went down to 5.4 percent in first six years of the Modi government, but increased after May 2020, though for other reasons.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdSince May 2020, with the Modi government’s launch of Aatmanirbhar Bharat policy, it gave hope that we might be able to reduce our dependence on Chinese imports and bring the manufacturing sector back on track and avoid security, health and economic risks arising from dependence on Chinese products.But, the recent reports about continued and increasing dependence on Chinese imports have raised an alarm not only about the efficacy of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat policy, but also about security and economic risks attached to Chinese imports. The Global Trade Research Initiative’s (GTRI’s) report has recently revealed that China and Hong Kong account for 56 percent of India’s total imports of electronics, telecom and other electrical products. Also, China has become India’s largest trade partner, where total bilateral trade with China has reached $118.4 billion in 2023-24, against $118.3 billion with USA. In this bilateral trade, share of Chinese imports is $101 billion, whereas exports are merely $16-17 billion. Though this figure of imports looks staggering, we see that during NDA regime the rate of growth of Chinese imports has been only 7.0 percent per annum, against growth of 29 percent during UPA regime.The GTRI report says that 15 years ago China accounted for 21 percent of our merchandise imports, and now in 2023-24, China’s share in merchandise imports has increased to 30 percent. Our dependence on China has not been limited to electronics, telecom and electrical, it has spread to eight key industrial sectors which include machinery, chemical and pharmaceuticals, steel and base metals plastic and articles, textile and clothing and automobile sector also.

 There are also a lot of scams that really aren’t very sophisticated at all — just new ways to exploit ordinary human failings. (Source: Bloomberg/Getty Images Europe) Payment frauds against consumers and small businesses are a huge problem, but in the UK at least the pace is slowing. Banks are fretting, however, that new rules on mandatory refunds for victims could be about to make fraud costlier. They’re right to be concerned.The latest industry data show that education and prevention efforts by banks, payment companies and regulators are making some progress: Total losses of £1.17 billion ($1.5 billion) in 2023 were down 4% from the year before, according to UK Finance, a trade body. Still, £1 billion is a lot to lose, especially for banks that refund many of the victims. And this could become more costly because Britain’s payments regulator is introducing rules that make full reimbursement of as much as £415,000 per case a lot more likely for all victims.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThe industry is worried that the new mandatory refund policy, which replaces a voluntary scheme, could make potential victims less attentive about spotting scams. Worse, with such a high payback almost guaranteed, the policy could even encourage people into conspiracies to defraud their own accounts, sharing the gains with crooked contacts. That might be an extreme risk, — but when the prize is large enough, the temptation increases.The alternative solution offered by UK Finance — setting the cap at £85,000 instead, in line with deposit insurance limits — isn’t necessarily a good answer. It creates the same incentives, but just lowers the protections available for real victims of major fraud. Most people don’t have that much money to lose to payment frauds, but occasionally people end up with temporarily large balances, for instance when selling a house. Deposit insurance allows much higher cover in those cases when banks collapse; similar allowances for losses to scams above an £85,000 cap would also be better.There are two kinds of payment fraud: Unauthorized, where your card or identity details are stolen, for example; and authorized, where you’re conned into handing over money or giving up key details.

 Staying happy and healthy in retirement. (Source: Bloomberg/Getty Images Europe) Retirement is expensive. If you’re lucky, yours will last a few decades, and you’ll be earning no or very little income. So if you want to have enough money when you retire, you basically have three options: Save more, take more risk with your investments, or work longer.Many people find the first and third options undesirable or impossible. That leaves the second option. And despite what people such as Marc Rowan might lead you to believe, there’s really no way to get a higher return without taking more risk.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdRowan, the CEO of Apollo Global Management, wants to allow Americans to invest more of their retirement money in private assets — credit and equity that aren’t sold in public markets. The practice, as he points out, is allowed in Australia, which is so pleased with its success that it plans to double its exposure to private equity in some accounts. The UK is also considering increasing its exposure for its retirement savers. In the US, however, only accredited (read: wealthy) investors have direct access to such assets.As Rowan sees it, people invest for their retirement for the long term. One reason private assets promise a higher return is they are less liquid. If you give your money to a private equity fund, it invests in assets that aren’t publicly traded, so you can’t sell them if you need to. After several years, the fund matures, and you get your money back with some return.In theory at least, you have been compensated for giving up liquidity with a higher return. If you don’t need liquidity — like most retirement savers, Rowan argues — you may as well get that illiquidity premium.

 Looking for the real GDP. (Source: Bloomberg/Getty Images) Large parts of corporate India aren’t exactly feeling the economy’s world-beating growth performance. But woe to those who dare to question it.The chief executive officer of the country’s largest decorative-paints maker learned that lesson on a recent earnings call. To an analyst’s question about the relationship between gross domestic product and paint demand, Asian Paints Ltd. CEO Amit Syngle said that the usual correlation of the business with fast GDP growth is out of kilter in the current year.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdAnd then he said something borderline controversial, suggesting that he’s looking at ways to find “the real GDP.”That widely publicized remark, doing the rounds on social media in the middle of a bruising, six-week general election, was enough to get the Mumbai-based firm worried. Syngle has referred to GDP often enough in the past, as a guidepost to business. But this time, the opposition Congress Party used his statement to poke a hole in the government’s claim that India is the world’s fifth-largest economy. “The comments were not, in any way, meant to question the sanctity of the GDP numbers as being projected,” Asian Paints said in a clarification last week.How often people decorate their homes, and how much they’re willing to pay for it, is a function of income growth: Paint demand in India tends to outpace GDP expansion by a multiple of 1.5 to 1.75 times. Since the nominal GDP growth rate in the year that ended on March 31 is estimated at about 9 percent, but Syngle’s sales only expanded by 3 percent in value terms, he has every reason to be a little perplexed about the official data. Last year, when the economy had grown by a little more than 14 percent in nominal terms, Asian Paints’ business had jumped by 20 percent.

If predictions of an above-average monsoon this year pan out, it will help agricultural output and support rural income, he said.A recovery in rural stocks is also welcome news for India’s broader stock market whose stellar rally in recent years was disproportionately spurred by investment-heavy firms benefiting from the government’s higher infrastructure spending. Further, bountiful showers can aid the central bank’s efforts to cool inflation by curbing gains in food prices, thereby improving prospects for India’s economic growth and corporate earnings.

This is despite public sector banks notching historic gains on the back of record improvement in their return ratios. Indeed, the Nifty PSU Bank index has clocked a colossal 79 percent gain.The culprits are private sector banks. Once the apple of investors’ eyes, private sector lenders have become laggards in almost all metrics. Emkay Global’s head of research Seshadri Sen brings out this trend in a report aptly titled “Waiting for Godot: the elusive turnaround”. Sen points out that private sector banks are “ex-growth” and no longer belong in the growth stocks group. These lenders face headwinds in revenues, profits and even book value per share over the next one year.Multiple factors are working against private sector banks but the biggest is regulatory punishments. HDFC Bank was the first to be pulled up for lapses in digital products and credit cards back in December 2020. It took the bank nearly a year to resolve all issues for the removal of business restrictions imposed on it by the banking regulator.

 Research has also shown that taking cannabis off the underground illegal market helps to drive it out of the illicit drug trade. (Source: Bloomberg) Turns out you can have too much of a good thing. Last week, Thailand’s Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin ordered a U-turn on the country’s landmark cannabis policy, saying the plant should be soon classified as a narcotic again and its use limited to medical and health purposes. This decision comes two years after the former premier Prayuth Chan-Ocha’s administration decriminalised the drug in the aftermath of the pandemic. His aim? To bring tourists back to Thailand, tap into the multibillion-dollar medical marijuana business, and help struggling farmers grow a cash crop.The prime minister’s announcement shouldn’t come as a surprise — the new government has been weighing its options for a while. The weed experiment hasn’t gone as planned. Rowing it back won’t be easy, but the kingdom should persevere and attempt to regulate this sector — even if the consequences are painful. Ignoring it will affect the nation’s youth and social harmony — ultimately the industry is only benefiting businesses, not poor farmers.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdWalking through the Thai capital Bangkok’s narrow alleyways recently, it was impossible to miss the numerous cafes that spilled on to the streets, or the distinct scent of marijuana wafting through the balmy air. These dispensaries sprang up seemingly overnight, after the decision to legalise cannabis was made in 2022. Even then it was controversial — and ever since, competing forces have been trying to reverse the decision.Of course, there can be benefits in decriminalising marijuana — one is less pressure on courts and prisons. There are major overcrowding issues in Thai jails, where 75 percent of inmates are there on drug-related charges. Research has also shown that taking cannabis off the underground illegal market helps to drive it out of the illicit drug trade.Many parts of the US have already been through this evolution. Cities like New York have now adopted a far more liberal approach to decriminalization, but are also struggling with the consequences. It is unlikely that Thailand could learn from its experience. Culturally it is a far more conservative society, and sits in a region with harsh drug laws around possession and consumption.

The news published on the date May 16, 2024 04:00 PM IST with headline  The long, slow decline in fund manager fees may be ending is: 
 One corner of the active ETF space represents the best shot traditional fund managers have of preserving their role in the investing landscape. Active exchange-traded funds have seen record inflows in recent years, taking assets under management to $630 billion. That’s a lot of money but small in comparison to the $10 trillion in ETF assets overall or the $24 trillion in public mutual funds registered in the US. Still, one corner of the active ETF space represents the best shot traditional fund managers have of preserving their role in the investing landscape.Active ETFs are mainly new distribution mechanisms for existing strategies. Almost all are linked to active public mutual funds — conversions (the public mutual fund is changed to an ETF), clones (an ETF with the same strategy and portfolio as the public mutual fund) or new share classes for an existing fund. These have little effect on the asset managers, only on the plumbing that connects them to investors. A few active ETFs are strategies launched specifically for this space, but they are not very different from active public mutual fund strategies.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThe place to keep your eyes is on a tiny sliver — less than $10 billion AUM — of the active ETF market: the semi-transparent and non-transparent ETFs exempt from daily portfolio disclosures. Opinions on these funds are sharply divided. ETF.com has declared them to be the “holy grail” of the asset management industry, though tepid early interest has led others to dismiss them as out of step with the transparency investors demand today.It seems too early to write off these secretive ETFs with most large fund managers having either issued such products or announced plans to do so, including JPMorgan & Co., Blackrock Inc., Legg Mason Inc., Gabelli Funds, Columbia Threadneedle Investments, Nuveen and American Century Investments. If these take off, they could cause fundamental changes to the asset management industry, giving managers a more prominent role and potentially arresting the Quicktakelong trend toward lower fees.A little history. The modern public mutual fund was created by the 1940 Investment Company Act. All these funds were actively managed until the early 1970s when the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first public mutual index fund. ETFs reversed this process, beginning life in 1993 as index funds, with active management only approved in 2008.

Two years ago there were major shocks to the prices of goods, food and energy, all of which have now dissipated. That’s why inflation is much lower now. The problem is that services inflation remains stubbornly high, and accounts for substantially all of headline inflation at this point.Services are people-heavy businesses in which wages are crucial drivers of prices. Unlike with food and fuel, monetary policy can be an effective counter to wage inflation, so this is an incentive for the Federal Reserve to keep rates where they are.Breaking this down further, the following chart shows inflation for owner’s equivalent rent (a highly contentious measure of shelter cost), and for two measures that were rarely cited before this surge in prices began, but which are now at the center of the debate. One is so-called “supercore” inflation, which measures services excluding shelter, and which the Fed regards as important, and CPI excluding food, shelter, energy and used cars. Most people do need to buy all of these things, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics began printing this number in 2021 at a point when inflationary pressure was concentrated in those items. This is what they look like.

 Market Dear Reader,The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdGlobal equity indices literally came back to life as Wednesday’s announcement of cooling US inflation brought relief to markets. The sigh of relief was palpable, given that the below-than-expected 0.3 per cent rise in April’s consumer price index (CPI) revives hopes of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2024. Stubborn and elevated inflation over the past six months had until recently stoked concerns of rate hikes, instead of cuts.To be sure, it would be investors’ and policymakers’ hope that this is not a one-off reading, but the beginning of the inflation curve trending lower. Some economists are not convinced yet. Bond yields and equities are showing relief. “There were no big positive surprises that would upend the market’s forecasts for interest rates,” says Financial Times’ Robert Armstrong in this article (free to read for MC Pro subscribers). One key reason stated for continued concern about rate cut expectations is that the improvement was more in the price of goods and not so much in services.In any case, bond yields fell and Wall Street’s benchmark indices rallied strong. Hope and optimism that the US Fed finally has a chance to consider rate cuts sooner than later, saw Asian markets open higher today. European equities too, are likely to toe the line of their peers.

Historically, the paint industry has grown at 1.5 to 1.75 times the GDP growth rate, the company statement said.“It was, hence, called out that there is a need for examining the GDP data to understand the reasons for this variance,” the company said, referring to the recent social media posts and media articles claiming that Syngle “raised doubts about the gross domestic product of India, at the investor conference”.

Both institutional and retail traders are drawn to this predictability.

 Even if rates fall in the short-term, there is a good chance they will settle at a higher level. Our holiday from history has come to an end. I am referring not to world peace but to the zero-interest-rate environment so many people expected would last forever. Despite all the talk about when the US Federal Reserve will cut rates and bring back those holiday vibes, there is a very real possibility that it will not matter when the cuts happen or how many there are.That’s because the interest rates that matter for much of the economy — longer term US Treasury bills — may not just be higher for longer: They may be higher forever. And that would mean a new era not only for investing but also for the economy.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdWhile the Fed exerts control over short-term Treasuries, the research is mixed on how much influence it has on longer-term bonds. And the 10-year is what matters for how capital is priced and what rates consumers face. Its price tends to be driven by macro factors: the growth and inflation outlook of the economy, global and domestic demand for safe US assets and, usually, the long-term debt of the federal government.But on our holiday from history, the bond market appeared to have entered a new era. No matter the economic environment, yields went down and so prices went up: It was one long bull market. To some extent, this was justified by a low-inflation environment, an insatiable demand for US debt from foreign governments, and various regulations that prized US bonds as the world’s safe asset.But bonds aren’t like stocks. Rates can fall only so low — no one will buy a bond that offers an -8 percent yield. In the 2010s, real rates hovered around 0 percent, in spite of the government piling on debt and a waning appetite for US debt from its more reliable buyers. But that may have been an anomaly. Research on the 10-year yield going back to 1300 shows how it trended down as the world got safer and financial markets deepened. At the same time, the bond market has always had periods of highs and lows, and rates tend toward the mean.

The news published on the date May 14, 2024 04:24 PM IST with headline  Emmanuel Macron wants more European megafirms. Good luck with that is: 
 Emmanuel Macron flagged cross-border deal making as one of many European economic taboos to break in a de-globalizing world dominated by subsidies, tariffs and technological arms races. French President Emmanuel Macron, seemingly more confident about France’s tepid economy and gridlocked politics after clinching €15 billion ($16.2 billion) in investments from the likes of Morgan Stanley and Microsoft Corp., is eyeing a bigger prize: Building more multinational European champions. Bonne chance, you might say.In an interview on Monday with Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait, Macron flagged cross-border deal making as one of many European economic taboos to break in a de-globalizing world dominated by subsidies, tariffs and technological arms races. “We do need a consolidation,” he said, apparently open to the idea of banks like BNP Paribas SA growing bigger and Societe Generale SA being sold. Citing energy, finance and telecommunications, he added: “We do need as well an actual domestic market as Europeans, which is not the case.”Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThe former investment banker has a point. Europe has some of the globe’s biggest firms and a market of 440 million consumers — and, thanks to LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, France also hosts the world’s richest person. But broadly speaking, from stock markets to telecoms to banks, national borders are still holding Europe back. Despite the economy’s similar size to the US and China, its companies have a tougher time gaining scale: The revenue gap between big European firms and their US rivals is around $6 trillion, according to McKinsey, and in flag-carrying sectors like telecoms, airlines and defense, that equates to a 30 percent shortfall.And yet, as Macron also knows from having himself engaged in all sorts of boardroom bust-ups in Europe, national preferences are very hard to dislodge — even in a time when European unity looks all too mortal. Look at the semiconductor industry, a key front in the Sino-American chip wars. While Europe has a genuine global champion when it comes to high-end chipmaker-equipment supply in the shape of ASML Holding NV, players like STMicroelectronics NV and Infineon Technologies AG look tiny next to Intel Corp and Nvidia Corp. Europe’s market share in chips is about 10 percent, and even the billions in funding being thrown at the industry to raise that number is splintered by nation: The US has allocated $32.8 billion in semiconductor funding and Europe $24.1 billion across three countries (France, Germany and the Netherlands).The benefits of a more integrated, pan-European sector would be big: A report on artificial intelligence by French experts found that it could unlock an extra €7.7 billion. But there’s a political price that leaders haven’t been willing to pay. With local jobs and geopolitical influence at stake, it’s grim but unsurprising to see reports that Italy’s government is pushing to receive a bigger share of investments made by Franco-Italian firm STMicro. Cross-border deals in chipmaking have recently been blocked on national-security grounds: Mergers and acquisitions data shows semiconductor deal making has been in decline since the pandemic and hit its lowest level in over two decades in 2023. And beyond chips, in sectors like telecoms, European antitrust regulators don’t seem convinced that big mergers would be worth the risk to consumers.

 Time for the EU to burnish its bonds. (Source: Bloomberg/Getty Images Europe) Now that the European Union has sold €513 billion ($550 billion) of debt, a stockpile poised to reach at least €800 billion by 2026, the bloc shouldaccelerate plans to qualify as a fully-fledged government bond market. Building a proper primary dealer network, augmented by repurchase facilities and futures contracts, would enhance liquidity, broaden demand from both euro zone and global investors and reduce borrowing costs for the bloc.MSCI Inc and Intercontinental Exchange Inc have issued consultation papers seeking views on the viability of reclassifying EU Commission issues as sovereign debt rather than supranational bonds. That matters because the latter trade at wider dealing spreads akin to corporate debt, while the former have a broader worldwide investor audience. And while MSCI and ICE are second-tier providers of the fixed-income benchmarks against which portfolio managers gauge performance, such a move would set a precedent that more established index compilers including Citigroup Inc, Bank of America Corp. and Bloomberg LP would likely follow.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThe EU had barely €50 billion of bonds outstanding before the pandemic hit; the sudden requirement for massive funding to underpin the economy led to a vast upscaling of borrowing by the commission. This kicked off with the SURE job support program in mid-2020, ramping up to the wider NextGen €800 billion program of loans and grants to member states — funded by mutualized debt sales.Qualifying as government debt would bump EU bonds higher up the fixed-income hierarchy when investors are considering where to put money to work. And that wouldn’t just be an intra-euro area dynamic; Mohit Kumar, chief Europe economist at Jefferies Financial Group Inc, reckons that demand from Asian and Middle East sovereign wealth funds would increase.The EU has AAA grades from the major credit-rating companies, yet trades at a modest yield premium to six euro nations — including France, which is rated two notches lower at AA by Standard & Poor’s Corp. So it’s easy to see how the momentum for lower borrowing costs for the bloc could build.

Brace for the latest dose of critical data on US inflation over the next three days, as the New York Federal Reserve publishes its monthly survey of consumers’ inflation expectations Monday, followed by the Labor Department’s report on producer prices Tuesday and consumer prices Wednesday. These reports will matter a lot.Of late, the mood has switched toward optimism that inflation is being tamed, while central banks that met last week either reduced benchmark interest rates, or suggested cutes were imminent. The latest data also show a US economy slowing in just the way the Federal Reserve wants to see. The jobs market has stayed obdurately strong throughout the post-pandemic fight against inflation. That makes it far harder for a central bank to be lenient. But last week, initial US claims for jobless insurance spiked to their highest level since August:Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThis is a noisy series, and last week’s result followed several low numbers, so the four-week moving average of claims remains in its recent healthy range. But a rise in claims like this is exactly what we would expect to see if higher rates were indeed beginning to slow the economy; if they continue to run at this level for another month, it would be far easier for the Fed to justify cuts.Meanwhile, the latest edition of the University of Michigan’s long-running survey of consumer sentiment showed a startling drop in both expectations and assessments of current conditions. Such negativity — when many in the market were braced for a strong “no landing” economy — came as a shock. It’s statistically significant. Again, numbers like this make rate cuts much easier to justify:The problem, as with so much else in 2024, lies with politics. Polarization has led to a wide divergence in economic perceptions.

Known for being value-conscious, the data shows that in the non-food category — such as home and personal care, beauty and so on — small players’ volume growth was a splendid 22 percent compared to 9 percent for the large players. Smaller players had stolen an edge by cutting prices by 6 percent while the large players actually hiked prices by 1 percent.But foods saw roles reverse as here large players cut prices by 3 percent compared to the smaller ones, who increased prices by 4 percent. The result, volumes grew by 8 percent compared to a decline of 4 percent, respectively. While this may seem like a tale of two halves, it is not. Non-foods contribute to nearly 81 percent of the industry’s sales, with foods contributing to the rest. Therefore, the impact of this shift on the industry is significant.The data underscores the point that while much is made about brand loyalty in the FMCG industry, when large price gaps develop consumers lose little time in switching these loyalties. This becomes more acute when they are already reeling under inflation, as Indian consumers have been in recent years.

(Representative image) A third year into an unprecedented housing downturn, China’s President Xi Jinping seems to be finally getting worried, prompting speculation of quantitative easing and fueling a bull run in Hong Kong-listed Chinese stocks.The latest readout from the Politburo meeting, released on April 30, explains investors’ excitement. The country’s 24 most powerful men (yes, all men) appeared open to taking a different approach to resolving the property crisis, calling for coordinated measures to digest existing housing stock.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThe last time the Politburo mentioned the real estate inventory issues was in mid-2016.

That initiative pulled China’s property and stock markets out of a slump. Since Beijing has been floating the idea of urban village renovation lately, Xi is essentially opening the door to his second bazooka.Two main questions arise from the Politburo’s vague wording. First, what prompted the change of heart from Xi, who has largely sat on the sidelines while the real estate crisis unfolded. Second, how big will the state funding be this time around?One possible explanation is that the broader economic slowdown aside, China’s property mess is finally coming for Xi’s cherished state-owned enterprises.

If your returns pay you more than you expected, chances are that you will repeat the process and set off a trend that will be adopted by others. Corporations use leverage, a synonym for debt, to set up factories, open new shops and grow their revenue. Households borrow to consume or meet emergencies. Investment funds borrow simply to move capital from a place of excess to a place of deficit and earn hefty returns in this process.But here is a catch that Archimedes knew about leverage, and we sometimes ignore. The lever (or leverage) should not be fat in a way that it is difficult to move. Too much of leverage can kill the balance sheet it is resting on. Howard Marks, investment guru and co-founder of Oaktree Capital Management, wrote in his latest memo, reproduced by FT here and free to read for Moneycontrol Pro subscribers, that investors must exercise caution in using debt. “The most important adage regarding leverage reminds us to “never forget the six-foot-tall person who drowned crossing the stream that was five feet deep on average,” Marks wrote.The heavier the burden you carry, the higher are the odds to sink. This was on display during the 2008 global financial crisis and India’s debilitating bad loan cycle of 2016-19. Is something similar happening right now?

The news published on the date May 10, 2024 10:18 AM IST with headline  Gold is becoming the new currency of the world, dollar losing its grip is: 
 India ranks 9th in the world in terms of official gold reserves. Since the First World War, dollar’s importance in the world has been continuously increasing. When America's allies started giving gold in exchange for their imports, the United States officially became the world's largest gold reserve. After the war, many countries linked their currencies to the dollar and with this the gold standard ended and the dollar became the most preferred currency in the world. All nations started maintaining foreign exchange reserves in the form of dollars, and thus by 1999, the share of the dollar in the total foreign exchange reserves of the world increased to 71 percent. At the same time, many European nations decided to adopt a common currency called ‘Euro’.Due to this, the share of the dollar and global reserve currency started decreasing. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the dollar's share as global reserve was 62 percent in 2010 and 59 percent in 2020 and 58.41 percent in 2023. Though the importance of the dollar is decreasing, it continues to remain the world's most preferred currency. It’s notable that, ‘Euro’ comes at a distant second place, and it constitutes barely about 20 percent. In terms of Indian rupee, where one dollar was equal to 4.66 rupees in 1964, it has now become much stronger compared to other currencies, to reach 83.4 rupees per dollar.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdSigns of De-dollarisation But for some time now, there have been signs of de-dollarisation in the world. Due to the continuous strengthening of the dollar, almost all the countries, especially the developing ones, have suffered hugely. The Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India have been constantly trying to increase the role of the rupee in international payments. In this regard, agreements and arrangements have been made with about 20 countries. On the other hand, due to the difficulty in international transactions, triggered by turmoil and especially the sanctions imposed by the US and European countries on Russia, efforts to make payments in local currencies have also increased in other countries.The world's aversion towards the dollar has further accentuated because US has confiscated all of Russia's dollar reserves, calling Russia, an aggressor. Other countries realised they may face payment problems like Russia. And so, they are making two-pronged efforts. One, payment in local currencies and second, increase in gold reserves in place of dollars.

 The requirement of keeping a greater amount of money to cover any defaults typically forces banks to raise lending rates to maintain profitability The Indian central bank’s proposals on project financing may add as much as 1 percentage point to the borrowing costs of renewables projects, according to a top consultancy firm, potentially causing a hike in wind and solar power prices in the country.Lenders will be needed to set aside as much as 5% of the capital they lend to infrastructure projects under construction, a draft by the Reserve Bank of India stipulates. That compares with the current norm of just 0.4% provisioning for standard assets. The allocation can come down to as low as 1% as the project matures and starts generating cash for repayment of the loan.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove Ad“It’s definitely going to have a bearing,” said Srishti Ahuja, a partner for infrastructure strategy and transactions at EY India. Besides raising the cost of funding, “it will also make it more difficult for projects under construction to get financing,” she told Bloomberg Television in an interview.If the proposals come into force, there could be a slowdown in the pace of deployment of renewables at a time when the nation is targeting to accelerate green energy installations to meet goals for 2030 and beyond.
